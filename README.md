# Snapseatlas.dk

The source code for snapseatlas.dk, except a few files that holds the password to the DB server...

This project started around 2013, and the web-page have been active sinde 2015

It's a Open-source, Open-data and Open-community project with the very real-life purpose of mapping locations of plants in the wild. 
Everybody can put plant groving locations on the map, and everyone can use (incl. download) the entire database.

## Snaps

Snaps is a type of alcohol (not completely different from vodka), and the plants of interest to Snapseatlas are those relevant for home flavouring (infusing) Snaps. 
This home flavouring of snaps is an old tradition in northern Europe, in particular in Scandinavia.

This project is focusing on plants in Denmark - therefore Snapseatlas.dk

## The Open source, data and community

As a coding project, Snapseatlas is a demonstration of how enybody can make theire own community mapping project, with litteraly a few lines of .html, .js and .php
We encurrage everybody to have a go at this. 

If you are a newbee you can use this project as a minimal viable template for an actually running community mapping project.

If you are more professional than us, we hope you will help us by sugesting improvements... 
The code-base have been running stabely for many years, but sure there are room forimprovements :-)

Best regards
The Snapseatlas.dk team
