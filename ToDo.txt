* Ver 0.9.0

We are now moved to a new ISP (NordicWay)
Things that could be done includes:

- Upgrade Leaflet to newer version, we are at least 0.3 versions behind
- Upgrade jquery to newer version, we are about 0.2 versions behind

- Leaflet.contextmenu seem quite dead, since late 2017... Consider alternatives, for long term support

- Make a real app for the mobile people :-)
